        <p>I resigned my regular contract with the Turkish National Ministry of Education as an English teacher. I moved to Malta as a translator for a Turkish company. As I was always interested and as I have courage to attemp to start a very new journey in my career I decided to learn how to code. I believe I will achive good things on this field.</p>
